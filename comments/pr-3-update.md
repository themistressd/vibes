ðŸŽ¯ IMPORTANT UPDATE: Remove the VibeSelector component completely. Instead, implement a mixed vibes approach where all profiles from different vibes are shown together in one feed. Each profile card should display their vibe as a colored badge (like the 'Active' badge in Tinder reference images). Vibe should also appear in their bio/description text. This creates a more natural discovery experience without forcing users to pre-select a vibe category. Use different colors for each vibe type: Chill (blue), Party (red/orange), Nature (green), Creative (purple), Adventure (yellow). The feed should be completely mixed - no vibe filtering or separation.
